I would like to thank the reviewers for their comments and suggestions. 



We have added a section detailing how to test the IoT languages in a dedicated eclipse instance.

I did some updates on the iot usecase files, in order to simplify their usage, each xtext language now has it own file extension: `iot_lua`/`iot_se`.

Those updates should also correct reviewer #2B and #2C issues.



The installation of EcoreTools 3.2 is not strictly mandatory but was suggested in order to keep the testing environment as close as possible to our development environment.
